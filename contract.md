#Contract

<h3>What does this group do when two or more members disagree?</h3>
Have a group meeting and discuss the issue. Compare pros and cons of each situation. Make sure everyone's opinions are heard and try to collaborate. If an agreement cannot be reached between the team members, contact a fellow and ask for their opinion.

<h3>What does this group do when a member is frustrated?</h3>
Try to address the issue professional and really try to listen to the frustrated member; try to understand their perspective and reason with them. If a person has a conflict with someone else, encourage them to have a open conversation about their frustrations; have someone mediate this conversation and make sure that both member's opinions are being heard.

<h3>What does this group do when we merge our work together? </h3>
Communicate that you're merging, have two other people sign off/review the merge.

<h3>When does this group ask for help?</h3>
We will first collaborate with each other and see if we can find a solution as a team. If we cannot find a solution after a productive struggle (30mins), ask for help from an outside source. If a member is stuck with an issue, they should first try to solve the issue on their own via online resources. If they cannot find a solution, ask a team member.

<h3>How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other? </h3>
Members should agree on norms together. If we are pairing, to stay productive do very few switches (maybe once a day).

<h3>How does this group approach work "after hours"? </h3>
Focus on completing tier one of the project. During tier one, don't work on the project after hours. After tier one, if a member would like to do extra work to refine the project, they may work after hours.

<h3>What time does this group have daily stand up? </h3>
10:30AM
